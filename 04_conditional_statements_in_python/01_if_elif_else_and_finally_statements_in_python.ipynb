    "# **`Conditional Statements in Python`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The primary keywords used for conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. The `if` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement evaluates a condition. If the condition is `True`, the block of code following it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. The `elif` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement allows you to check multiple expressions for `True`. It is used when you have more than two conditions to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Code if condition2 is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "elif age >= 16:\n",
    "    print(\"You can apply for a learner's permit.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. The `else` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement is an optional final statement that executes if none of the preceding conditions are `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code if condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code if condition is False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 15\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. The `finally` Keyword**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` keyword is used in exception handling. It defines a block of code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This is useful for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that will always execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()  # This will execute whether or not an exception occurred\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Real-Life Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases for `if`, `elif`, and `else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Authentication**:\n",
    "   - Check if a user is logged in and what role they have, allowing different actions based on their role.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_role = \"admin\"\n",
    "   if user_role == \"admin\":\n",
    "       print(\"Access to admin panel.\")\n",
    "   elif user_role == \"editor\":\n",
    "       print(\"Access to edit content.\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Access denied.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grade Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Determine a student's grade based on their score.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   score = 85\n",
    "   if score >= 90:\n",
    "       print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "   elif score >= 80:\n",
    "       print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "   elif score >= 70:\n",
    "       print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Grade: D or F\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases for `finally`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that files are properly closed after operations, regardless of whether an error occurred.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       # Process the file\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()  # Ensures the file is closed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Connections**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that a database connection is closed after performing operations, even if an error occurs during the operations.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   connection = None\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       connection = connect_to_database()\n",
    "       # Perform database operations\n",
    "   except DatabaseError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Database error: {e}\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       if connection:\n",
    "           connection.close()  # Ensures the connection is closed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`if`, `elif`, and `else`** are fundamental for controlling the flow of execution based on conditions, allowing for decision-making in programs.\n",
    "- The **`finally` keyword** is crucial in exception handling, ensuring that certain code blocks always execute, which is essential for resource management and cleanup.\n",
