    "# **Nested `if`-`else` Statements in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested `if`-`else` statement is an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. This allows for more complex decision-making by evaluating multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Syntax of Nested `if`-`else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition1\n",
    "    if condition2:\n",
    "        # Code block for condition2\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Code block if condition2 is False\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code block if condition1 is False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Example of Nested `if`-`else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "citizenship = \"USA\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    if citizenship == \"USA\":\n",
    "        print(\"You can vote in the USA.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You can vote, but not in the USA.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- The first `if` checks if the person is at least 18 years old.\n",
    "- If they are, the nested `if` checks their citizenship.\n",
    "- Depending on the citizenship, different messages are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Indentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper indentation is crucial in Python, as it defines the scope of the code blocks. Each level of nesting should be indented consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Real-Life Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. User Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use nested `if` statements to control access based on user roles and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_role = \"editor\"\n",
    "has_edit_permission = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if user_role == \"admin\":\n",
    "    print(\"Access to all resources.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    if user_role == \"editor\":\n",
    "        if has_edit_permission:\n",
    "            print(\"Access to edit content.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Read-only access.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Access denied.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Grade Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can classify grades based on scores using nested conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 60:\n",
    "    if score >= 90:\n",
    "        print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "    elif score >= 80:\n",
    "        print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: F\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Loan Eligibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine loan eligibility based on income and credit score.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "income = 50000\n",
    "credit_score = 720\n",
    "\n",
    "if income >= 30000:\n",
    "    if credit_score >= 700:\n",
    "        print(\"Loan approved.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Loan denied due to low credit score.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loan denied due to low income.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Weather Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide on activities based on weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature = 30\n",
    "is_raining = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 25:\n",
    "    if is_raining:\n",
    "        print(\"Take an umbrella and go for a walk.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"It's a great day for a picnic!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Stay indoors and enjoy a warm drink.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nested `if`-`else` statements** allow for more complex decision-making by evaluating multiple conditions.\n",
    "- Proper **indentation** is essential for defining the scope of each condition.\n",
    "- Real-life use cases include user access control, grade classification, loan eligibility checks, and weather-based decisions.\n"
