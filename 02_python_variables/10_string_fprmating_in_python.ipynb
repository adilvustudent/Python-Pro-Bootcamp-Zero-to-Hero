    "# **`String Formatting in Python`**\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting is a powerful way to create and manipulate strings in Python. It allows you to embed values into strings dynamically, making your output more readable and structured. Python provides several methods for string formatting, which are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Basic String Concatenation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to format strings is through concatenation using the `+` operator. However, this method can become cumbersome and hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "  age = 30\n",
    "  greeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \". You are \" + str(age) + \" years old.\"\n",
    "  print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice. You are 30 years old.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Using the `format()` Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` method provides a more flexible way to format strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \"string {} {}\".format(value1, value2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "  age = 25\n",
    "  greeting = \"Hello, {}. You are {} years old.\".format(name, age)\n",
    "  print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Bob. You are 25 years old.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positional and Keyword Arguments**:\n",
    "  You can also use positional or keyword arguments with `format()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Positional**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    greeting = \"Hello, {0}. You are {1} years old.\".format(name, age)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Keyword**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    greeting = \"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.\".format(name=name, age=age)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. f-Strings (Formatted String Literals)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  f\"string {expression}\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Charlie\"\n",
    "  age = 28\n",
    "  greeting = f\"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "  print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Charlie. You are 28 years old.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressions**: You can include any valid Python expression within the curly braces.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  greeting = f\"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Percent Formatting**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an older method of string formatting that uses the `%` operator. It is less common in modern Python code but still worth knowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \"string % value\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Diana\"\n",
    "  age = 22\n",
    "  greeting = \"Hello, %s. You are %d years old.\" % (name, age)\n",
    "  print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Diana. You are 22 years old.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Formatting Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting allows you to control the appearance of numbers, such as specifying decimal places or including commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  pi = 3.14159\n",
    "  print(f\"Pi rounded to two decimal places: {pi:.2f}\")  # Output: Pi rounded to two decimal places: 3.14\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comma as a Thousands Separator**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  large_number = 1000000\n",
    "  print(f\"Formatted number: {large_number:,}\")  # Output: Formatted number: 1,000,000\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Multi-line Strings**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to create multi-line strings, which can also be formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Eve\"\n",
    "  age = 35\n",
    "  info = f\"\"\"\n",
    "  Name: {name}\n",
    "  Age: {age}\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  print(info)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting in Python is essential for creating readable, dynamic strings. Understanding the various methods—concatenation, `format()`, f-strings, and percent formatting—allows for greater flexibility and clarity in your code. F-strings are generally recommended for their simplicity and efficiency, especially for newer versions of Python. By mastering string formatting, you can create more user-friendly and informative outputs in your programs.\n",
