    "# **`Issues with Python Programming language`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Performance Limitations**\n",
    "   - **Speed**: Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C or C++. For CPU-bound tasks, this can be a drawback.\n",
    "   - **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: The GIL allows only one thread to execute at a time in a Python process, which can be a limitation for multi-threaded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory Consumption**\n",
    "   - Python can consume more memory than some other programming languages due to its dynamic typing and object overhead. This can be a concern for memory-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mobile Development**\n",
    "   - Python is not commonly used for mobile app development, as languages like Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) are preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Limited Support for Functional Programming**\n",
    "   - While Python supports functional programming concepts, it is not as robust as languages that are designed primarily for that paradigm, like Haskell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Weak in Mobile Computing**\n",
    "   - While there are frameworks (like Kivy), Python is not a primary choice for mobile app development compared to Java or Swift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Library Dependencies**\n",
    "   - Dependency management can be tricky, especially in larger projects, leading to issues like version conflicts and \"dependency hell.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Python's dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors that may not be caught during development, which can be a disadvantage compared to statically typed languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Learning Curve**\n",
    "   - Although Python is often praised for its readability, certain advanced features (like decorators and metaclasses) can be challenging for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Community and Ecosystem**\n",
    "   - While Python has a vast ecosystem, not every library is well-maintained, and you may encounter outdated or poorly documented libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Frame Your Answer\n",
    "When discussing these issues in an interview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Balanced**: Acknowledge that, despite these limitations, Python remains a powerful and widely-used language.\n",
    "- **Provide Context**: Mention scenarios where these issues might impact a project, but also discuss how they can be mitigated (e.g., using Cython for performance).\n",
    "- **Show Adaptability**: Emphasize your ability to choose the right tool for the job and how you compensate for Python's limitations in your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Answer\n",
    "\"In terms of limitations, Python does have some performance drawbacks, especially for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL, which can hinder multi-threaded applications. Additionally, its memory usage can be higher compared to some lower-level languages, which is something to consider for large-scale applications. However, for many use cases, these issues can be mitigated by using libraries like NumPy for performance-critical code or implementing best practices in dependency management. Overall, while Python may not be the best fit for every scenario, its ease of use and extensive libraries often outweigh these concerns.\" \n",
