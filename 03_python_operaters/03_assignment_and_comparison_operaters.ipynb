    "### **Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance your understanding, try the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program that uses assignment operators to compute a running total and prints the final result.\n",
    "2. Create a function that checks if two numbers are equal and returns a message based on the result using comparison operators.\n",
    "3. Experiment with combining arithmetic and comparison operators in more complex expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these operators, you'll be better equipped to manipulate data and control the flow of your Python programs!\n"
