    "# **`Loops in Python`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition. Python primarily supports two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. For Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or dictionary) and executes a block of code for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterating through collections:** Accessing elements in lists, tuples, dictionaries, or sets.\n",
    "- **Processing data:** Reading and processing data from files or databases.\n",
    "- **Generating sequences:** Creating new lists or arrays based on existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. While Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User input validation:** Repeating prompts until valid input is received.\n",
    "- **Event-driven programming:** Waiting for a condition (like a response from a user or an external system) to occur.\n",
    "- **Game loops:** Continuously running the game until a win/lose condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Nested Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use loops inside other loops, known as nested loops. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        print(f\"i={i}, j={j}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix operations:** Iterating through rows and columns in a 2D array.\n",
    "- **Combinatorial problems:** Generating combinations or permutations of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Loop Control Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Break Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(10):\n",
    "    if num == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Continue Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(5):\n",
    "    if num == 2:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pass Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement is a null operation; it is used when a statement is syntactically required but you do not want any command or code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(5):\n",
    "    if num == 2:\n",
    "        pass  # Do nothing\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Real-Life Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Reading a CSV file and processing each row to extract relevant data or perform calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Using a `for` loop to iterate over pages of a website to collect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Game Development:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** A game loop that continuously checks for user input and updates the game state until the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automation Scripts:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Automating repetitive tasks such as sending emails or processing files in a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simulations:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Running simulations (like Monte Carlo simulations) where a process is repeated many times to analyze results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Machine Learning:**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Iterating over epochs to train a model, adjusting weights based on performance at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusio**n\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data efficiently. Mastering loops in Python will significantly enhance your programming capabilities and enable you to tackle a wide range of real-world problems."

    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterates over sequences:** The `for` loop can iterate over various data types, including lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- **Easy to read:** The syntax is straightforward and enhances code readability.\n",
    "- **Supports the `enumerate()` function:** You can get both the index and the value when iterating over a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Looping through Dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "When looping through dictionaries, you can access both keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ages = {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}\n",
    "for name, age in ages.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"{name} is {age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Nested For Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest `for` loops to iterate over multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",

    "for num in range(10):\n",
    "    if num == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(num)  # Outputs 0 to 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. `continue`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(5):\n",
    "    if num == 2:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(num)  # Outputs 0, 1, 3, 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed and is often used as a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(5):\n",
    "    if num == 2:\n",
    "        pass  # Placeholder for future code\n",
